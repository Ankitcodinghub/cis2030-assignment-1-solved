Structure and Application of Microcomputers

(1) Read through the assignment questions before listening to the lectures.

(4) Review your answers a few days after completing the assignment. Taking a few minutes to do this can dramatically improve your understanding of key concepts and increase your retention.

Submission: Submission of this assessment is a two-step process that involves (1) uploading your written work as a single PDF to the Dropbox on CourseLink, and (2) entering only the final answers to the assignment questions under the Quiz Section on CourseLink. Only assignments that complete both steps will be marked. The overall submission procedure is outline below.

(2) While in CourseLink, now click on the Quizzes tab on the navigation bar. On the Quiz List page, you will see a quiz called Assignment 1. Click Start Quiz. Then, answer each question using the final answers that you have already determined. As you complete each question, the answer will be automatically saved. You can see which questions have saved answers in the Questions section of the quizâ€™s left panel. You can also click the question number in the quizâ€™s left panel to go back to the question. Click Go to Submit Quiz after you answer all quiz questions.

Best of success!

Use the following information to answer questions 1-5:

Assume that a computerâ€™s memory contains the following sequence of eleven 8-bit (hexadecimal) values: 0x55, 0x6F, 0x47, 0xBB, 0x6E, 0x96, 0x68, 0x42, 0xC8, Ox80, 0x00.

2. Interpret the next two 8-bit values in the sequence as one unsigned 16-bit integer. Convert the integer to decimal. [1 mark]

3. Interpret the next 8-bit value as a signed, 2â€™s-complement value. Convert the integer to decimal. [1 mark]

4. Interpret the next 8-bit value as an unsigned fixed-point fraction with an implied binary point in front of the left-most bit. Convert the fraction to decimal. [1 mark]

6. 0x1234

7. 0xC432

8. 0x8F03

9. Add the following two binary numbers: 10101 and 1011. How many carries

11. The maximum unsigned binary number that can be represented in a certain computer has a decimal value of 4095. What is the word size of this computer? [1 mark]

12. A certain computer has a 12-bit word size. What is the largest positive decimal value that can be represented on this machine assuming a 2â€™s-complement representation? [1 mark]

Use the following information to answer questions 13-21

A and B are integer variables in a computer program, with A = 10710 and B = 4210. The program is running on a computer that uses 8-bit 2â€™s-complement arithmetic.

13. Show how A is represented in binary. [1 mark]

Show how -A is represented in binary. [1 mark]

Show how B is represented in binary. [1 mark]

Show how -B is represented in binary. [1 mark]

14. Show how the machine would compute A+B. [1 mark]

15. Did A+B produce signed overflow? Explain. [1 mark]

16. Show how the machine would compute A-B. [1 mark]

17. Did A-B produce signed overflow? Explain. [1 mark]

18. Show how the machine would compute -A+B. [1 mark]

19. Did -A+B produce signed overflow? Explain. [1 mark]

20. Show how the machine would compute -A-B. [1 mark]

21. Did -A-B produce signed overflow? Explain. [1 mark]

22. A 5-bit IEEE floating-point representation has the following parameters: a single sign bit, two exponent bits (i.e., K=2) and two fraction bits (i.e., n=2). What is the exponent bias? [1 mark]

Use the following information to answer questions 23-25

According to the round-to-even rule, show how the following binary fractional values would be rounded to 1 bit to the right of the binary point. In each case, show the numeric values as decimal (integer and fractional) values both before and after rounding. [1/2 mark for each before and after]

E.g., 100.010 (e.g., 4 and1/4) before; after rounding 100.01 (e.g., 4)

23. 100.011

24. 100.110

25. 101.001
